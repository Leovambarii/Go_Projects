# **Go Projects Repository**

This repository contains various projects implemented using the Go programming language. Below is a brief description of each project:

# **Project 1: dadjoke**
This is a simple CLI tool that fetches a random dad joke from the icanhazdadjoke API and displays it in the terminal.

It was created as an introduction to the Go and CLI language included in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/-tO7zSv80UY).

# **Project 2: todo**

This is a command-line interface for managing a todo list. It allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks, as well as list all current tasks.

It was created as an introduction to the Go and CLI language included in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/j1CXoOQXbco).

# **Project 3: booking**
This is a command-line application in Go that allows users to book tickets for a conference. The application uses the standard input/output to interact with the user and provides feedback on the booking status.

It was created as an introduction course to the Go included in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/yyUHQIec83I).

# **Project 4: food_recipies**
Recipe finder is a CLI application that accepts two arguments: ingredients and numberOfRecipes.

This project allows the user to find recipes based on a list of ingredients using the Spoonacular API. If the same list of ingredients and number of recipes have been previously searched for, the package retrieves the cached information from a MySQL database instead of using the API. The package returns recipes in the terminal, sorted by number of missing ingredients.
