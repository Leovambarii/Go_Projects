# Dadjoke CLI

This is a simple CLI tool that fetches a random dad joke from the icanhazdadjoke API and displays it in the terminal.

It was created as an introduction to the Go and CLI language included in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/-tO7zSv80UY).

## Usage
To use the Dad Joke CLI, run the dadjoke random command. This will fetch a random dad joke and display it in the terminal.
```
go run main.go random
```
